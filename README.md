## Social_Media_Analysis

This repository contains the code and SQL queries used for the Social Media Analysis project. This project is part of the Data Analytics Course at SevenMentor. In this project, we work with a dataset related to social media interactions. The goal is to analyze various aspects of a social media platform, including user interactions such as comments, likes, follows, posts, hashtags, photos, and videos.

## Project Overview

The goal of this Project is to answer several specific ad hoc requests using SQL queries. The data used in this project encompasses user interactions on a social media platform, allowing for comprehensive analysis of comments, likes, login, follows, posts, hashtags, photos.

## Problem Statement

1. What is the average number of posts per user?
2. 2. What is the location of each user?
3. Which are the most followed hashtags?
4. Which are the most used hashtags?
5. Who is the most inactive user?
6. What is the average post count per user?


## Project Structure
- SQL Files: The SQL queries for each of the analysis requests can be found in the SQL files. These queries are designed to extract and manipulate the necessary data to answer specific questions.


## Database and Tools
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench 8.0


## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into user interactions on a social media platform by leveraging SQL queries to analyze various data points. By examining the average number of posts per user, user locations, the popularity of hashtags, and identifying the most inactive users, we gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and engagement. These analyses can inform strategic decisions to enhance user experience, optimize content strategies, and improve overall platform performance.
